<h2>A1</h2>
<p>For this assignment, I chose to do poem 4. This one was most diffuclt for me to do but I tried to take the overall theme of the poem and express it musically. I have it set up as 3 distinct parts. Part 2 and part 3 are signaled by an erupt guitar chord that symbalizes the sudden struck mentioned within the poem. Part 2 has to do with looking into past experiences, so I tried using the choir to express an ambient atmosphere. In part 3, I tried to express the moving forward tone of the poem with quick guitar transitions</p>

<h2>A2</h2>
<p>In this assignment, I focused more on the behavior of the two figures and tried to express their movements through automation and panning. I also used a backing track to express an aquatic tone to the music</p>

<h2>A3</h2>
<p>For this assignment, I tried to stick to the brief as much as I could. For the first part of the video, I have a moderate guitar pace being played along with some machine noises and a subtle beat in the back. The second part, I have a beat being played in the backround as well as siren noises going off. In the third part, I sped up the guitar melody and raised the volume of the beat to enrich the texture</P>

<h2>A4</h2>
<p>For this assignment, I didn't have time to develop the sounds for each movemnt, so I chose to focus on the music portion for the game. I tried to make the music simple but at the same time progressive to make it interesting</p>
